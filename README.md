Our submission documents: Report.pdf and VideoReport.mov have been left out of this repository. The original README has also been edited to exclude student numbers and references to these documents. [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) was used to scrub the repository of the documents and sensitive information. The remainder of that README follows.
